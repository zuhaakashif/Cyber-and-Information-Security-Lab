### **Tips for Adding Screenshots Professionally**
- **File Organization:** Create a `screenshots` directory in your project folder to store all screenshots.
- **Image Size:** Ensure that your images are properly resized and compressed to avoid slowing down the loading time.
- **Consistent Naming:** Use clear and consistent naming conventions for your image files (e.g., `homepage.png`, `core_members.png`, etc.).
  
This structure ensures clarity while keeping the document visually clean and professional.
